# Experimental Project

Welcome to the experimental part of my journey! This branch contains various experiments and attempts as I explore and learn new concepts.

## Folder Structure

### Attempt 1 - Chatbot Graveyard

The `Attempt 1` folder is a collection of several unrelated experiments aimed at understanding how things work. It may appear messy, but it represents the latest era of my struggle during this term. Feel free to explore this folder to see the evolution of my learning process. There are approximately 10 more amateur versions of these experiments that are not included in this repository.

### Attempt 2 - First Blossom

In the `Attempt 2`, I tried to create something more stable. I experimented with using a more strict transformers model to obtain exact answers from the knowledge base as a way to deal with hallucinations. However, this approach lacked elegance and felt like a blunt way to tackle the problem.
