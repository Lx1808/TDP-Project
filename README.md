# Experimental Project

Welcome to the experimental part of my journey! This branch contains various experiments and attempts as I explore and learn new concepts.

## Folder Structure

### Attempt 1

The `Attempt 1` folder is a collection of several unrelated experiments aimed at understanding how things work. It may appear messy, but it represents the latest era of my struggle during this term. Feel free to explore this folder to see the evolution of my learning process. There are approximately 10 more amateur versions of these experiments that are not included in this repository.

### Attempt 2

In the `Attempt 2`, I tried to create something more stable. I experimented with using a more strict transformers model to obtain exact answers from the knowledge base as a way to deal with hallucinations. However, this approach lacked elegance and felt like a blunt way to tackle the problem.

## Upcoming Features

I am excited to announce that I have recently added an exciting new feature to this project! Currently, I am working on improving the bot itself to enhance its capabilities and performance. Stay tuned for the latest version, which will be available here on May 18, 2024.

## Conclusion

Thank you for visiting my experimental project repository. I appreciate your interest in my work and hope you find the experiments and attempts insightful. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out.

See you soon!
